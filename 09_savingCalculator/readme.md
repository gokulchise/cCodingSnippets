3. Rate of return                                                           \
4. Total years                                                              \

##Computation:
Year 1:                                                                     \
    Start Balance = balance                                                 \
    Interest = Start Balance * (Rate of return / 100)                       \
    End Balance = Start Balance + Interest + Annual Investment              \

Year 2:
    Start Balance = End Balance                                             \
    Interst = Start Balance * (Rate of return / 100)                        \
    End Balance = Start Balance + Interest + Annual Investment              \

Year X:
    ....                                                                    \
    ....                                                                    \
    ....                                                                    \
